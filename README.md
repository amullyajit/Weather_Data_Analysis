# Weather data analysis
Introduction :- 
The Weather Data Analysis using Data Analytics project aims to analyze weather data to understand city-wise climate patterns. By leveraging Python and visualization libraries, the project uncovers insights into temperature trends, seasonal variations, and precipitation patterns. This analysis aids in climate research, forecasting, and urban planning.

Goal:- 
To analyze weather data and understand city-wise climate patterns.

Focus areas include temperature trends, seasonal variation, and precipitation analysis.

Why It Matters :-
Supports climate research and forecasting.

Aids urban planning by analyzing climate patterns.

Dataset Overview :-
Dataset Used: Weather.csv

Number of Entries: 25,500

Key Columns: Date, Temp Max, Temp Min, Rain

Time Span: Data from 1951 onwards

Data Cleaning: Standardized column names, removed rows with missing temperature or precipitation values.

Tools & Technologies :-
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation), Seaborn & Matplotlib (visualization)

Development Environment: Google Colab, VS Code

Data Cleaning & Processing :-
Datetime Conversion: Converted the Date column to datetime format for time series analysis.

Average Temperature: Calculated from Temp Max and Temp Min.

Column Renaming: Renamed "Rain" column to "Precipitation" for clarity.

Handling Missing Values: Removed rows with missing temperature or precipitation data.

Analytical Approach ;-
Monthly Temperature Trends
Objective: Analyze how temperature varies month by month across years.

Findings:

Summer Months (May to July): Highest average temperatures.

Winter Months (December and January): Lowest average temperatures.

Seasonal Consistency: Stable climate patterns across years.

Daily Temperature Variation
Objective: Explore daily temperature changes over a long period.

Observations:

Day-to-day fluctuations reveal extreme temperatures and seasonal transitions.

Some years exhibit anomalies indicating potential climate change effects.

Correlation Analysis
Features Analyzed: Temperature and Precipitation

Visualization: Heatmap of correlation coefficients

Insights:

Weak or inverse correlation between temperature and rainfall.

Indicates that other factors may significantly influence climate changes.

Key Insights
Seasonal Trends: Temperature peaks in summer and drops in winter.

Temperature Range: Consistency in temperature variations over the years.

Weak Correlation: Minimal relationship between rainfall and temperature.

Outliers: Specific unusual weather patterns indicating unique events.

Results & Future Work
Results: Successfully visualized weather patterns and identified monthly and seasonal trends.

Future Enhancements:

Add more features (like humidity) for comprehensive analysis.

Incorporate machine learning for predictive climate modeling.

Enhance data visualization with interactive plots.
